For the next few moments, research amongst yourselves the answers to the following questions:

- What is an API?

	A library of pre-defined methods to accomplish various tasks.

	Fundamentally, an API is a layer of abstraction between a set of tasks that a developer wants to accomplish, and the developer's actual source code. 

	One reason for this layer of abstraction might be so that a set of tasks is simpler for a developer to implement. For example, jQuery is an API, and it provides several methods to make DOM manipulations easier than vanilla Javascript.

	Another reason for an API's layer of abstraction might be so that sensitive tasks are exposed to developers, provided the correct credentials. For example, the Twitter API has methods which can allow a developer to create new tweets on a user's behalf.

  Thus, an API can serve many possible purposes. An API could allow a developer to quickly retrieve data from another person's database; to utilize someone else's more complex functionality (like maps); or to control other hardware and software.

- What does API stand for?

	APIs stand for Application Programming Interfaces.

- What are some examples of APIs? (Find links to specific APIs)

	AirBNB uses Google's API for maps: https://www.airbnb.com/s?s_tag=_s84SXqA
	
	Google Searches for Weather uses the Weather API Weather Search: https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=weather+new+brunswick

	jQuery: https://jquery.com/

- What do these specific APIs allow you as a developer to do?
