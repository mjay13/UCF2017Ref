# AJAX to HTML

## File

* [`ajax-to-html`](Unsolved/ajax-to-html.html)

## Instructions

* Go to the [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/)

Using `ajax-to-html.html` as a starting point, fill up the HTML table with information about your own favorite movies.

HINT: You will need multiple AJAX Calls

BONUS: If you have time incorporate post images with your favorite movies. (Note: You won't have permission to access all images, but many will work. Keep experimenting!)
