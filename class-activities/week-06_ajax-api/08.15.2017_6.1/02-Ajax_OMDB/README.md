## Parts of the API call to note:
  - queryURL
	- GET
	- done
	- response

## Questions to consider:
  - What does AJAX stand for?
  - Why is the .done function is necessary?
  - Why does the code after the AJAX request happen before the API results are logged?

## Logging JSON:
	- How would you parse out and retrieve the movie's runtime or actors list in response?
