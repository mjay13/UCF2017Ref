* Folder: `01-Chirpy-mySQL/Unsolved`

* INSTRUCTIONS:

  * Using the app skeleton provided to you:
    * Create a MySQL database named `'chirpy'` with a `'chirps'` table to hold your data.
    * Your `'chirp'` table should include a field for `id`, `author`, `body` (the chirp), and `created_at` (the time the chirp was created).
    
        ** Time created fields are usually called `created_at` and another common 
        timestamp field is `updated_at` for annotating the most recent update to the
        data
    * Modify the connection.js file to create a connection to your database.
    * Modify the api-routes.js file so that there is a route for adding a new chirp, as well as retrieving all chirps.
    * Modify the chirps.js file so that the page interacts with the database.
