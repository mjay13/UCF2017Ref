# jQuery Calculator

## File

* [`jquery-calculator-starter`](Unsolved/jquery-calculator-starter.html)

## Instructions

* Create the JavaScript logic necessary to add functionality to the jQuery Calculator.

* Your calculator should be able to handle basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.

* You should be making use of the existing buttons.

* You should be making use of the existing placeholders for entering content (i.e. "firstNumber", "operator", "secondNumber", "result").

* You should have fun and push yourselves! This is a challenge activityâ€”which means, if you get it done, you are a King of jQuery. If you don't, no sweat. The important thing is that you learned at least a FEW things along the way.

/*		Proceed at your own pace, but try 
/*	to match the Phase Timing as shown in 
/*  the blocks below
/*
/*		Phase I Objectives - 20 Minutes
/*
/*****************************************/
For this first 20 minutes, your goals should be to:
- Become familiar with the various elements of the HTML page as it is written now. (Identify the classes and IDs that matter!)
Create a general strategy for how you will accomplish the task:
- How will you capture button clicks?
- What will you do with the numbers clicked?
- What will you do when the operator is clicked?
- How will you differentiate numbers from operators?
- How will you know the "value" of a number clicked?
- How will you know when a user is done entering the first number? Etc.
- Create a few test "on-click" events. These could just trigger Alert messages for now. If you get further along, then have these buttons alert their "value".

/*		Phase II Objectives - 30 Minutes
/*
/*****************************************/
For the next 30 minutes, your goals should be to:
- Begin creating sets of variables that you think you will need. As a few suggestions:
  -- firstNumber, secondNumber, operator, result
- Create code that captures the numbers from button clicks, and then displays them on the HTML.
- Create code that captures an operator click, then immediately tells your code to begin recording the second number. (Example: If a user hits the "plus" button, you know they are done typing the first number).
- Create code that checks which operator the user has clicked, then saves this operator for later use in a conditional statement. (Example: If a user hits the "plus" button, you know you will need to be adding two numbers. If a user hits the "minus" button, you will need to be subtracting two numbers. Think: If-Then statements!)

/*
/*		Phase III Objectives - 40 Minutes
/*
/*****************************************/
For the next 40 minutes, your goals should be to:
- Complete the functionality you are missing in your code.
- Spend a few moments really assessing what you still have to do.
- Get a TA/Instructor to help you set priorities if you are unsure as to how to proceed.

/*****************************************/
/*
/*		Phase IV Objectives - 25 Minutes
/*
/*****************************************/
For the last 25 minutes, your goals should be to:
- Complete any remaining functionality in your calculator
- Handle bugs and edge cases (Example: What if a user tries to type in more numbers after getting the result? Will that mess up the screen?)
- Create code to "restart" the calculator after a user hits "clear".
