# **Instructions**

* It's time to test your skills in creating databases and tables as you create a database called `top_songsDB` which will eventually house all of the music data contained within `TopSongs.csv`

* Columns contain the artist name; song name; year; raw popularity score for the song from the entire world; and then one column for each of the raw popularity scores for the song from the USA; UK; Europe (i.e., non-English speaking countries in Europe); and the rest of the world, respectively.

* "raw score" numbers reflect the "total value of music industry sales", where a higher raw score indicates a greater volume of sales.

* Within your database create a table called `Top5000` and create columns capable of holding all of the data contained within `TopSongs.csv` properly.

* All of your code should be written and saved within a filed called `schema.sql` so that you can use this same code later should the need ever arise

* HINT: Try to have your table's columns match those within the CSV file as closely as possible or else you may find the next step in this assignment more difficult than it would otherwise be

* BONUS: Create a `seeds.sql` file that contains the data for the first three songs found within `TopSongs.csv`

* BONUS: Look into how MySQL Workbench can import and export data files. What file types does it accept? How does it convert the data?
