Instructions

Create a User class. It should:

Store the user's first name; last name; and email address. It should set these upon instantiation. You'll need to use a constructor for this: http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.decon.php

Store a URL for the user's profile image. Don't set this in the constructor, but write a method that can set this property after the object is created.

Write a method to return the user's full name.

Should any of this information be private?

We should probably make the first name and email address required, but it's okay if users don't want to share their last names. With your partner, brainstorm a way to set the last name to a default if users don't provide one.

What order should you put your constructor arguments in to make this easy?
Finally, create a short script, and instantiate a few users. Print their full name to make sure everything is wired up right.
