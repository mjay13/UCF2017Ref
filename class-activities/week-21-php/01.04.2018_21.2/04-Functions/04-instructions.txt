Instructions: In the last exercise, our foreach statement got a bit cluttered.

Create a file called helpers.php.

Write a function that echoes to the screen, but includes a newline.

Write a function that prints a separator to the screen.

Let it take a parameter specifiying how many separators to print.

If the user passes none, set a default value: http://php.net/manual/en/functions.arguments.php

Write a function that tests if a name is long, and returns the appropriate string.

Write a function that determines if you're drinking sake tonight, and returns the appropriate string.

Make these functions available in your solution to the last exercise, and refactor your foreach statement.
