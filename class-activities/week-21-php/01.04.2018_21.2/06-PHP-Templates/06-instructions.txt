Instructions: Using the Boilerplate directory, fire up a server on port 8000.

Look up PHP's documentation on superglobals: http://php.net/manual/en/language.variables.superglobals.php

Open content.php. In your browser, change the URL to the following:

http://localhost:8000?name=John&email=john@doe.com

You might want to read about query strings for this part: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string

Next, add <? php print_r($_GET) ?> just after opening your container div.

Dicuss what you see with your partner. Be ready to share your thoughts with the class.

Reset the URL and enter a name and email with the form. Note the URL. What effect do you think this has on $_GET?

Repeat the above step, but change the form's method to POST.
- What effect does this have on the URL?
- Which superglobal do you think this information is in?



---- AFTER CLASS DISCUSSION ON $_GET ----

Instructions: Pull in the User class you built earlier.

Figure out how to create a user whenever you can get at least a name and email address from the URL query string.

If you can create a user, add a header that greets them.

If you can't, add a header that says, "Hello, Stranger!"

You'll want to use the shorcut syntax for echo in the template: http://php.net/manual/en/function.echo.php

Figure out how to do the same if the form data is sent via POST.

Write a function that figures out which of the two methods the form used, and gets information from the correct superglobal. Consider this exercise optional.

Hint: You can use $_SERVER, but you don't need to.
